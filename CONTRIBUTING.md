## Helping Out

Currently this project is in my personal namespace here on GitHub. If the project takes of we can create a community org around it. So currently if you have a bug/issue use the [issues tracker](https://github.com/johnweland/weather-station/issues). If you are solving an issue or bug, fork the repo make your changes and then submit a PR. I will do my best to get it reviewed and merged in in a timely fashion. If you see a place for a feature or enhancement, start a thread and lets talk about it.
